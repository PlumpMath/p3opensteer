Installation Instructions
*************************
To build and install p3opensteer, follow these instructions.
Clone the source:

 git clone https://github.com/consultit/p3opensteer.git

Enter the source folder and tweak config.ini as desired; in particular, 
you can change the optimization level, as by putting optimize=1 or 2
would compile the support for the debug drawing.
Then executes:
 
 python build.py 
 
Everytime you update the library or change configuration (config.ini)
issue this command
 
 pyhton build.py --clean
 
In doubt issue always this last command.
 
Note: p3opensteer uses a slightly modified version of "Panda Module 
Builder" by tobspr (https://github.com/tobspr/P3DModuleBuilder) as 
build system, so refer to that for more informations.

To install copy the generated p3opensteer module into the folder of 
your code, and into into your code put imports similar to these:

 import panda3d.core
 from p3opensteer import *
 ...
 
That's all.
